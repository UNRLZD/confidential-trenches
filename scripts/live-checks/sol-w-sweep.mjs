// Live check of card sol-w-sweep on SIGN_HOST (https://sign.confidential.unrealized.trade). The signing page's pool sell
// (packages/signpage/src/pool-sell.ts, checked by rules/pool.ts) empties a fresh Solana wallet W into the user's pool
// balance, so what SIGN_HOST serves is what a device signs. What it proves, and only that: the served /app.js is the one
// index.html pins (its sha384), and its text carries the card's rules, each found by a mark of the bundle's shape (the
// minifier renames, never restructures them):
//   - a full sell deposits W's surplus with its proceeds (a reserve under 0), a partial sell leaves it on W;
//   - a full sell keeps on W only what lifts the rent back's sweep to the floor once W's token account is closed (the
//     floor, the sweep's fee, mark and page growth, one frame's fee, less rent(165)), and on a cashback coin a later
//     claim's cost; when the reserve cap refuses that, rent(0) only, as before;
//   - the sell's rule: a reserve under 0 no larger than W's lamports;
//   - a sweep that leaves W exactly what each owed cashback claim costs later (rent(0), a frame's fee, the claim
//     account's rent), at most two, checked by the sweep's rule;
//   - the sweep goes on when every account kept is a volume account owed cashback only (the kit's plan marks them),
//     W ending "owed" (its record kept) when the rest is under the floor.
// It does not prove those lines run: that is the signing page's tests at the released commit (test/pool-sell.test.ts,
// rules-pool.test.ts), and that the served files are that commit's build is signpage-release's.
